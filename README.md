# Deep-Learning-quantitative-trading-model
This project builds a deep learning framework using technical indicators to trade algorithmically.
The frame work consists of a CNN along with multiple transformer architecture in series as to predict the closing price of the next "n" days.


Code Explanation.pdf - In depth working of how the framework works along with results over large cap NYSE companies.
